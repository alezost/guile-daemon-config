* About

This is my configuration for [[https://github.com/alezost/guile-daemon][Guile-Daemon]].  Currently I use it as the
OSD daemon, i.e. I use it to display something (clock, sound volume or
just some text) on screen using [[https://github.com/alezost/guile-xosd][Guile-XOSD]].

* Files

- =init.scm= is the config file itself.  Along with =(xosd)= module from
  Guile-XOSD, it uses some of my [[https://github.com/alezost/guile-config][guile modules]].

- =scripts= directory contains a couple of shell scripts that send
  expressions to the Guile Daemon using =gdpipe= (it is a part of
  Guile-Daemon).  This directory is placed in my $PATH so I can use such
  commands as =osd-text hello= or =osd-sound sset Master 3%+=.  For
  example, I bind several keys to such =osd-sound= commands in my
  [[https://github.com/alezost/stumpwm-config][stumpwm config]].  The result may be seen in the gif demo above.
